# ChescaSpellingApp
A desktop application for spelling quiz created with C#.

## General info
This project is specifically made for my daughter, Chesca.
I noticed that she feels challenged everytime she is asked to spell something. The goal is to make her feel comfortable enough in spelling words she might encounter her day to day life.
I run a task scheduler daily to run this program.

## Word list
We have words.txt for a list of words the project randomly chooses from.
